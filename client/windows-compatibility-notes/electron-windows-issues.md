# Windows Compatibility Issues in Electron Client

## Identified Issues

### 1. Package.json Scripts
- `electron:start` uses `wait-on tcp:3000 && electron .` which may not work reliably on Windows due to command chaining
- No cross-platform solution for starting the development environment
- No specific script for Windows development
- No postinstall script defined, but postinstall failures were mentioned

### 2. Electron Configuration
- `nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false` in main.js may pose security risks
- No Windows-specific icon or application metadata defined

### 3. Build Configuration
- Windows build configuration is minimal, missing important settings like:
  - Windows-specific icon
  - Installer configuration
  - File associations
  - Auto-update configuration

### 4. Development Environment
- No clear instructions for Windows developers
- No cross-platform path handling for development vs production environments

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Update package.json scripts to use cross-platform solutions
2. Add proper Windows configuration in electron-builder
3. Implement cross-platform path handling
4. Add Windows-specific assets (icons, etc.)
5. Create proper scripts for Windows development and building
